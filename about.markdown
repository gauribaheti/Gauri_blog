I'm Gauri Baheti, a freshie in the MEMS department at IIT Bombay. Well, there is a lot to mention about me and my hobbies, because I basically love to do everything!
I love to dance; have completed my Praveshika Pratham in Kathak and recently I am trying my hands at contemporary.
Apart from this, I'm a rejected (by my family) singer and a pasta lover.
I'm an aspiring Entrepreneur, currently working on a startup with a three more friends at IIT Bombay. 
I love to travel with my friends and recently went on a trip with my college friends. Would soon update about the trip in my new blog.
